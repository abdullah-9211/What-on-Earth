# What-on-Earth
Mobile Game on climate hazards and awareness. Implemented using Java and Firebase

## Description

- Users have to manage the Earth.
- Different statistics like Deforestation, deaths, water levels etc are used to determine the state of the Earth.
- Each continent has it's own statistics.
- Front end is implemented using java whereas all the data is stored in Firebase Database.
- Firebase auth is used for user authentication (login and sign up).
- Players are asked different problems and provided with options of possible solutions.
- Every solution solves the problem but has a positive or negative effect on some stat.
- According to the choice made by the user, the Earth is affected and the game goes on.

This is how the game works. It is an endless game and only ends if the Earth becomes uninhabitable (decided according to stats).
